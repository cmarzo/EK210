Our goal was to design a device that tests a biometric response in order to win a game of two truths and a lie. The biometric response should be one that can be actively controlled, we chose breath rate, so that the desired response can be triggered in order to win the game. The results are then indicated using an RGB LED and the degree of certainty is demonstrated as the percentage on the LCD screen. In order to accomplish the desired outcome of the project we trialed with biometrics such as breath rate and heart rate where we found that breath rate was far easier for the player to control. We were able to measure breath rate using a conductive band attached to a adjustable strap and then attaching two alligator clips to the conductive rubber. We then developed a code that measured the resistance of the conductive band when someone was breathing deep and rapidly compared to at a normal pace. Using this code we were able to calculate the percentage of certainty, display whether the user was lying or telling the truth and have RGB LED flash red or green depending on the results.
